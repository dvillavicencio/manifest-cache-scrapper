# Manifest Cache Scrapper
Truly this might not behave like a scrapper, but it can because its a GoLang program. This program runs a series of functions that populate a Redis cache with Destiny 2 manifest entities so that they can be easily accessed later without going back to the manifest again.

The only real requirement is that Redis must be running in port 6073
